# Face Mask Recognition using CNN

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for face mask recognition. The model is trained to classify images into two categories: "With Mask" and "Without Mask." It uses a publicly available dataset from Kaggle to train and evaluate the model's performance.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model consists of two main folders:
- **With Mask**: Images of individuals wearing a face mask.
- **Without Mask**: Images of individuals not wearing a face mask.
